As soon as I saw this project, I thought "I like this", because I knew it could be a bit challenging, and I felt capable of achieving it if I did it with enough effort and concentration.

In this project, I don't think I had any specific new learning during the creation of this project, rather it was like the final task that brought together everything I had already been learning, and I enjoy challenges like those.
